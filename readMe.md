# Les petits plats - Recipe Website Project

## About This Project

This project is part of the OpenClassrooms program *'Développeur d'application JavaScript React'*. This project is part of the digital transformation of a fictional company that has specialized in publishing cookbooks for several years, **Les petits plats**. The company has decided to create its own recipe website, similar to platforms like Marmiton or 750g. As a front-end developer, I was tasked with implementing a robust first version search engine for the site, allowing users to quickly find recipes through both a main search function and a filter system.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a fast and efficient recipe search feature based on a provided JSON file containing 50 recipes. I used the provided images for each recipe to ensure the final product matches the Figma design mockups. The search functionality will be a key differentiator for the site, offering users an almost instant search experience.

## Key Features

- Search Algorithm: Developed a high-performance search algorithm to allow users to find recipes efficiently by typing keywords into the main search bar.
- Filter Functionality: Implemented a filtering system where users can narrow down recipes by categories, ingredients, and other tags, providing a more refined search experience.
- Responsive Design: Built a responsive UI using Bootstrap, ensuring compatibility across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- Data Handling: The project uses a JSON file with a set of recipes to simulate a real back-end. This enabled the creation of a front-end prototype that closely mirrors the final product.

## Algorithm Design

The logic behind the search and filter functionalities is illustrated in the file **algorigrams.drawio**, which contains diagrams detailing the step-by-step process of the search algorithm. These diagrams serve as a guide to better understand the flow of the algorithm and the interactions between various components of the system.


## Tools & Technologies

- Front-end Framework: Bootstrap (CSS only)
- Programming Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Data: JSON file for recipe storage and management
- Design: Followed Figma mockups to ensure adherence to the project’s design specifications.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/belaidSolene/les-petits-plats.git
```

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the site.

## Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://belaidsolene.github.io/les-petits-plats/).

## Future Improvements

- Integration with a real back-end to handle dynamic data loading.
- Optimization of search algorithm to handle a larger dataset as the number of recipes grows.
